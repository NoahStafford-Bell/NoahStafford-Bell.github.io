	<center><h2>Architecture</h2></center>
		<p>Architecture is the art and style of designing and creating a building, as well as the skills asociated with construction.</p>
		<p>If you take a moment to look and observe the buildings that you might walk past every day, but have never actually taken the time to observe, you will open your eyes to a world full of shapes, different geometries complementing eachother, and angles that you wouldn't think possible in a normal brick and morter box.</p>
		<p>With the right angles and settings you can transform a normal ordinary structure or building into a beautiful display of colours, shapes, geometry, and angles, like a feast for the eyes.</p>

		<center><h2>TIPS FOR TAKING ARCHITECTURE PHOTOS</h2></center>
			<br>
			<p>Taking architecture photos is reasonably easy and simple and you can be very creative with it too, you can experiment with all things, angles, lighting, and focus.</p>
			<p>A tripod is a very helpful tool when it comes to taking photos of buildings, a tripod helps to keep the camera stable while you shoot, and can keep blur and movement to a minimum. When taking photos of architecture in most cases you are aiming to capture clear and crisp imagery of the subject, and a tripod 100% helps with that.</p>
			<p>Angles and how you shoot your subject can be experimented with, changed and adjusted to your liking and to your satisfaction, try getting low, to create a sense of scale and power and convey a more ominous feeling, maybe tilt the camera a bit for some more action in the frame, these shots are called 'canted shots' and you can get very interesting results when you tilt or angle your camera.</p>
			<p>Composition is also something to think about in order to enhance your image, making everything even can really create a good and balanced shot, you can also experiment with things like, rule of thirds and other ways to compose your shots.</p>
			<p>Lighting is also a very important aspect of any photo, as without lighting you literally can't see anything. So when you are setting up to take a photo, keep in mind the lighting of the shot. Good lighting can really complete and bring together a shot.</p>
