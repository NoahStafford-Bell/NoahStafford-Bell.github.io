		<p>My name is Noah, I love cars, sport, music, film and photography, I love using cameras to capture moments in sport, nature, and everything in between.</p>
		<p>Photography and Videography are both such amazing things that, are so accessible to so many people these days, and they don't even know it, these days your phone can take pictures at an industry level standard. you can take a beutiful photo of anything just using that device that you use everyday to text and call.</p>

		<center><h2>LEARN MORE</h2></center>
		<p>One of my favourite websites to learn more about photography overall would definetly be the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography">National Geographic Photography</a> website, as there are heaps of talented photographers on there who all share their work, and it can be awesome to browse through and find some photographers and photos you like.</p>
